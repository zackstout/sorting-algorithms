# Sorting Algorithms
Getting some computer science practice by exploring sorting algorithms.

- [x] Bubble sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [x] Quick sort
- [x] Merge sort
- [x] Counting sort
- [ ] Heap sort

## Testing
- Bubble sort takes about 650 ms on average (for a length-10,000 array).
- Counting sort takes about 10 ms on average (for a length-10,000 array).
- Insertion sort takes about 850 ms on average (for a length-10,000 array).
- Quick sort takes about 30 ms on average (for a length-10,000 array).
- Merge sort takes about 70 ms on average (for a length-10,000 array).
